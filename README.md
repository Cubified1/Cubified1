## Hello There!

<p> I'm Cubified, and I'm 16. I have recently gotten into coding. I'm inspired and driven by the results and the people around me, and with what I will be able to achieve once I master the Coding languages I want to learn.</p>
<p> I want to be able to make my own things. Be able to understand how a code works when I look at it, and help other people around me. I'm currently learning Python and starting to learn C#, and I know which languages I would like to learn next. </p>

<p> The sound of making your own tools/programs is something that sounds nice to me, as I can create something that will help me or be able to edit something to fit my needs. </p>

<p> and 1 thing I would let you guys know is that I LOVE the movie "All about Lily Chou Chou"</p>
